# New Feature Ideas for the Ski Instructor App

Here is a list of potential features and improvements that could be implemented to enhance the application's functionality and user experience.

### 1. Calendar and Scheduling System
- **Visual Calendar:** Implement a full calendar view (day, week, month) to display all scheduled lessons visually.
- **Direct Manipulation:** Allow adding, editing, and deleting lessons directly from the calendar interface.
- **Conflict Detection:** Automatically check for and flag scheduling conflicts.
- **External Calendar Sync:** Integrate with popular calendar services like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.

### 2. Advanced Client Management
- **Detailed Client Profiles:** Expand the client section to include detailed profiles with contact information, skill level, personal notes, and a complete history of their lessons.
- **Progress Tracking:** Add a feature to track a client's progress and goals over time.
- **Client Grouping:** Allow instructors to group clients, for example, by family or as part of a ski club.

### 3. Expanded Financial Tracking
- **Payment Status:** Add the ability to mark lessons as "Paid" or "Unpaid" to track outstanding payments.
- **Invoicing:** Generate simple invoices or payment reminders for clients.
- **Expense Tracking:** Introduce a section for tracking business-related expenses (e.g., equipment, travel, lift passes).
- **Financial Reports:** Create functionality to generate monthly or yearly financial summaries.

### 4. Implement the "SkiX" Feature
- **Social/Community Hub:** Develop the currently placeholder `SkiXPage` into a social feed or community hub. This could be a place for instructors to share updates, photos, or tips, creating a professional network.

### 5. Lesson Packages and Discounts
- **Service Offerings:** Allow instructors to create and sell lesson packages (e.g., a bundle of 10 hours at a discounted rate).
- **Flexible Pricing:** Implement a system for applying discounts to individual lessons or loyal clients.

### 6. Notifications and Reminders
- **Automated Alerts:** Send automated email or push notifications for upcoming lessons.
- **Weekly Summaries:** Provide a weekly email summary of activities, hours logged, and earnings.

### 7. Profile Enhancements
- **Profile Completion:** Fully implement the `CompleteProfileModal` to ensure instructors fill out their profiles with essential information (bio, photo, certifications).
- **Public Profile Page:** Create a shareable public profile page for each instructor that they can show to potential clients.

### 8. Data Export
- **Export Functionality:** Allow instructors to export their data—such as lesson history, client lists, or financial reports—to standard formats like CSV or PDF for record-keeping.

### 9. Multi-Language Support
- **Internationalization:** The app is currently in Italian. Adding support for other languages (like English, German, French) would significantly broaden its potential user base.

### 10. Offline Mode
- **Offline Functionality:** Implement a basic offline mode that allows instructors to add or view lesson information without an internet connection. The app would then sync the data automatically once connectivity is restored.
